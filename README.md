# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-University-Campus-Network
# Overview of the Physical & Logical Topology
The complete network integrates:
• 12+ switches
• 3 routers
• Multiple VLANs
• Inter-campus links
• Servers
• Wireless access
• Printers and end devices
The network includes  critical servers such as Web, FTP, and Email servers, with static addressing for reliability.  Comprehensive testing—including ping, DHCP validation, routing verification, server access,  and email testing—confirmed that the network operates efficiently with stable end-to-end  communication.
